# Angular Portfolio 2025 - Deployment Ready

## Status: Ready for Vercel and Supabase Deployment

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in navigation component
- [x] Added explicit typing to computed signals in AuthService
- [x] Created vercel.json for Vercel deployment configuration
- [x] Verified Supabase configuration in environment.prod.ts
- [x] Build command configured for production

### Deployment Configuration:
- **Vercel**: vercel.json created with build command and output directory
- **Supabase**: Database URL and anon key configured in environment.prod.ts
- **Angular**: Production build tested and ready

### Next Steps for Deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard (if needed):
   - SUPABASE_URL (optional, already in code)
   - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (optional, already in code)
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Verify Supabase database connectivity

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts` - Added explicit types to computed signals
- `src/app/shared/components/navigation/navigation.component.ts` - Added explicit type to injected service
- `vercel.json` - Created deployment configuration

The project is now ready for deployment to Vercel with Supabase integration.
